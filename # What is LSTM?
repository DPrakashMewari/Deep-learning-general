# What is LSTM?
Long short term memory network.Are special kind of RNN.
It is capable for long term Dependency.

* It is designed for avoiding dependency problem Such as Vanishing gradient Descent

Three Components of lstm which each parts performs an individual function.

Forget Irrelvant Information <--> Add/Update new Information  <--> Pass Updated Information.

*First part will see it is relevant or it can be forgotten 

*Second part try to learn new information from input to this part 

*Third part will pass the updated information which was current timestamp to next timestamp
