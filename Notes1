What is Deep Learning ?
Deep Learning Mimics the Human brain.


A.Neural Networks : Is something that is meant to simulate work as human brain

Structure

Input Layer :
f1,f2,f3

Hidden Layer
any no of layer

Output layer
any number 
binary,or anything

--------------

How neural Networks works?

Input  -> Hidden ->Op

Input 
x1 ,x2
|w1
|
Hidden 
|w4
|
output
----------------------------

for example :
y = w1X1 + W2X2 + W3X3
Y will pass to hiden layer 

The two operation will going to happen...
1) y = f(âˆ‘w1x1,w2x2+bi)

# Activation function
2) z = Act(y)
# Sigmoid 
<0.5 not activated, > 0.5 will activated
Based on that label assinged will be output
